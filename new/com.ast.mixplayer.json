The official image and logo as well as a Spectrum analyzer.\nIf by chance there's a loss of internet connection, the app tries reconnecting 5 times with a gap of 10 seconds. If that fails you have to manually press O on the OUYA-controller to start again.\n\nSpeaking of buttons: O = play/pause and A = quit the app",
